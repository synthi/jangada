# Felucca licensing

Felucca is free software. Its **code** is licensed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3 only (`GPL-3.0-only`, full text in `LICENSE`). Its **assets** are not part of
that licence: the icon atlas `assets/icons.png`, the panel image `docs/panel.jpg` and the drum sounds made by
`tools/gen_waves.py` (the Hügelton Sample Pack) are Copyright (C) 2026 Hügelton Instruments,
all rights reserved. Their licence terms will be published later.

## What is code (GPL-3.0-only)

Every file in this tree that carries an `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only` header:

- the firmware: `firmware/` (app, HAL, update loader)
- the build script and tools: `build.sh`, `tools/`
- the web pages (installer, editor) and their tests: `web/` (not the Fukiai font, below)
- the host tests: `tests/`

You may use, study, change and share it under the GPL. If you distribute Felucca, or
firmware derived from it, you must also give your recipients its complete corresponding
source under the same licence. That includes devices that ship with modified Felucca
inside.

## Additional permission (GPL-3.0 section 7)

As an additional permission under GPL-3.0 section 7, you may combine Felucca, or a work
based on it, with the Felucca Assets (above), and convey the combination.
This is allowed even though the Felucca Assets are not licensed under the GPL, provided
that:

- you follow the GPL for every part that is not a Felucca Asset; and
- you follow the terms published for the assets.

The Felucca Assets are data (wavetables, icons, sample data). They are not program
code. A firmware image built from the GPL sources with replacement assets, or with no
assets, is entirely governed by the GPL.
