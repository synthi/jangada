**TL;DR:** connect your FM-1 to a computer by USB, open the
[web installer](https://hugelton.github.io/Felucca/) in Chrome or Edge, and press Install.
No extra hardware is needed. Beta: use at your own risk; M-VAVE's own updater takes you back
to the official firmware.

Multi-engine synthesizer firmware for the M-VAVE FM-1.

## Features

- **Nine engines** (below), each with its own factory presets
- **Four tracks:** three synth parts, each with its own engine and sound, plus a GM drum track;
  8 voices shared between the parts. ALGORITHM selects the track on every page
- **Sequencer:** 64 steps per track with chords, ties, accent and slide; live loop recording
  with overdub and held notes; each track loops on its own length
- **Arpeggiator**, scales and quantize, glide, MONO / LEGATO / UNISON voice modes
- **Effects:** distortion and the SLICER per track; chorus, delay and reverb sends; master limiter
- **Presets:** factory presets with their own patterns, 32 user preset slots, 4 project slots
- **Web editor:** every parameter of every track, step grid, track mixer, preset library, sample upload
- **USB:** class-compliant MIDI in and out (channels 1–3 for the parts, 10 for drums);
  updates over the same USB cable

## Engines

- **ANALOG**: virtual analog; two oscillators (saw, square, triangle, sine, PWM), noise, drive, resonant low-pass filter
- **DIGITAL**: 4-operator FM, 8 algorithms, feedback
- **PHASE**: phase distortion (ported from CrispyZebra)
- **LOFI**: chiptune; pulse, triangle, saw, noise and a 4-bit wave RAM, stepped envelope, sweep, arpeggio
- **SAMPLE**: multisampled instruments and 3 user sample slots
- **VOICE**: formant oscillator, sung vowels
- **TRIO**: 3 oscillators with ring modulation and sync, multimode filter (LP / BP / HP / notch)
- **WHEEL**: tonewheel-style organ; drawbar registrations, percussion, key click, drive, rotary speaker
- **GRAIN**: granular textures from the built-in samples or a user slot

**SLICER** (FX page, every track including drums): a tempo-synced 16-step gate or stutter, with 16 patterns.

- Install: [web installer](https://hugelton.github.io/Felucca/) (Chrome or Edge, USB), or `tools/fm1_install.py` from a terminal
- Editor: [web editor](https://hugelton.github.io/Felucca/webapp/editor/)
- Build: [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)

## Scale keyboard

On the **SCL** page, set **QNT** to WHITE to play the selected scale using only the
white keys (SNAP keeps every key and rounds it down to the scale). C4 plays **ROOT**; consecutive white keys play consecutive scale notes
above and below it. Black keys are silent, including during live recording and
step entry. **TRN** transposes the resulting notes; the octave buttons shift them
by full octaves. Set QNT to OFF for the normal chromatic keyboard.

Available scales: chromatic (CHR), major (MAJ), natural minor (MIN), Dorian (DOR),
Mixolydian (MIX), major pentatonic (PEN), minor pentatonic (MPEN), harmonic minor
(HARM), Phrygian (PHRY), Lydian (LYD), Locrian (LOC), ascending melodic minor (MEL),
minor blues (BLUES), whole tone (WHOLE), half-whole diminished (DIMHW), and
whole-half diminished (DIMWH). Scales with other than seven notes continue across
the white keys without repeating notes; their roots need not fall on every C key.
The drum track, GM sample kit and incoming MIDI retain their existing note mapping.
