/* Jangada: the encoders' quadrature decoder with detent counting, no hardware here, so the host
 * can test it (tests/enc_test.c). fm1_input.h runs it once a scan frame (~1.1 ms) per encoder.
 *
 * Jangada (after SLOOP 2.3 / Felucca 1.0, its #23 "knobs skipping or jumping"): an FM-1 detent is
 * one full quadrature cycle (4 transitions) and the knob rests in one state, the one seen at
 * power-on (relearned only after FM1_ENC_REST frames, ~1 s, parked elsewhere). Steps are emitted
 * on arriving back at it, the net transitions rounded to whole cycles (>= 2 counts one: a lost
 * transition or two is forgiven; a two-state jump counts on in the direction of travel). One
 * click = one step at any speed; bounce and back-and-forth cancel out.
 * Never a second rest state. Felucca 0.9 learned rest states from any 25 ms pause, and Jangada
 * 0.2 from ~260 ms rests counted as evidence (a state and its complement): a knob held mid-click
 * that long, often enough, taught the complement as a rest and every click counted twice from
 * then on; short mid-click pauses of a slow turn taught the mid states and the knob went dead.
 * tests/enc_test.c plays both against this one. */
